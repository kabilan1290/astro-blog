> What if AI could be tricked without anyone noticing?

- Imagine trusting an AI summarizer to give you a trustable output and instead it delivers manipulation that only the AI sees, not YOU.

- Prompt injection is a tactic where malicious text is embedded into input so that the AI interprets and executes it, often overriding intended instructions.

- The twist: Invisible prompt injection. Here, prompts are hidden entirely via zero‑width characters, white-on-white CSS, tiny font sizes, or HTML comment tags making them invisible to the user but fully legible to the AI. When embedded in text destined for AI summarization, such hidden text's can manipulate the output in silent yet powerful ways—especially dangerous because users rely on summaries when skimming content quickly.
